## Forword

Bread is science. Not shit, making bread is not something you can improvise, precision is required.

Also bread is time. I've tried many recipes found on internet promising one baguette in 1 hour: it's just one hour wasted for an unsatisfiying result.

A perfect bread should be crispy outside and airy inside, it must be perfectly salted (so you don't perceive it) and must not taste baker's yeast.

Thing is my brother spent much time trying to find how to cook the same baguette you buy at the bakery. Actually he did not share his recipe until now, but during covid19 confinement, he got pity of me and his son Louis sent me the recipe as video tutorial, this was cute and now I'm sharing it to you.

## What you need

* One kitchen scale (0.1g precision required)
* Oven, capable to heat up to 240 deg celsius
* One perforated oven plate
* Clean hands and dusted with flour

| Ingredients |
| --- |
| 7g of fresh or dehydrated baker's yeast |
| 420g of flour |
| 7g of salt |

## Steps

To have bread at lunch time, begin the evening before.

### 1. La poolish

In a "cul de poule" (literaly "chicken's ass" but a mixing bowl is fine):

* Add 160g of ambient water
* Add 3g of baker's yeast

![poolish_1][poolish_1]

* Mix
* Add 150g of flour
* Mix until it's homogeneous

![poolish_2][poolish_2]

* Cover it efficiently with platic film
* Keep it all night in a fresh place, in a cave or a garage or in the fridge if you don't have choice

### 2. Le pétrissage

If you want bread at lunchtime, begin around 8/9am, otherwise you can also start during the afternoon.

![petrissage_1][petrissage_1]

* Mix 150g of ambient water with 4g of baker's yeast
* Pour it in the poolish bowl
* Add 280g of flour
* Add 7g of salt

![petrissage_2][petrissage_2]

* Knead the sticky dough during 10 mn (if you have a Thermomix: 12mn / 37 deg / Mess mode)

![petrissage_4][petrissage_3]

* Pour the dough on a wood plate, cover it under a bell

![petrissage_5][petrissage_4]
![petrissage_6][petrissage_5]

* Wait at least 1h30, it is "la pousse"

### 3. La détente

* Split the dough into n pieces (6 pieces works well)

![faconnage_2][faconnage_2]

* Wait 15 mn, it is "la détente"

### 4. Le faconnage

* Oil a bit your oven plate, then bread will not stick to it

* For a baguette:

    * Take a piece of dough
    * Spread it with your finger to have a rectangle
    * Fold it in its lenght
    * Lightly tap to seal the dough
    * Roll the dough
    * Put it on the oven plate

* For a miche:

    * Take a piece of dough
    * Spread it with your finger to have a rectangle
    * Fold it in its lenght
    * Fold it in its width
    * Lightly tap to seal the dough
    * Put it on the oven plate

![faconnage_4][faconnage_4]
![faconnage_5][faconnage_5]

* Cover the plate with a tea towel
* Put it in the fridge 1h

### 5. La cuisson

* Warm up your oven to 240 deg celsius, put a mug of water inside to humidify the air
* Brush dough with water or use a water spray

![cuisson_1][cuisson_1]

* Incise doughs with a sharped knife, to form "la grigne"

![cuisson_2][cuisson_2]

* Sprinkle flour

![cuisson_3][cuisson_3]

* Put the plate in the oven
* Throw away a cup of water inside the oven before closing it (actually my favorite part of this recipe), this will bring much humidity at once

![cuisson_4][cuisson_4]

* Cook it 20 to 30 mn, it's ready when the crust looks perfect to you

_Bread crumbs is not as airy as it should on this picture (#fail)._

## Side notes

Home made bread is... home made, there is no antioxidant, so it will stay crispy less than one day, use a better flour to make it last more. Keep it in a tea towel.
